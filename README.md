# HCC-2016-TSSE
This is the GitHub repository for the CSCE-655: Human-Centered Computing graduate course project

Our aim was to build a Technology Shopping Support Environment. As per the course website:
"By a Technology Shopping Support Environment (TSSE), we mean an interactive environment that helps people engage in comparative shopping, in which they make decisions about what specific product to buy, given a particular device category and associated needs. A shopper chooses the final product by comparing multiple candidate products. You can make your TSSE as general or specific as you like. Examples of device categories include mobile phone, personal computer, graphics card, game console, food processor...
We are specifically defining the comparative shopping scope  as involving integrating information from multiple web sites."

I chose mobile phones as the technology product and collected data for products from the following 3 websites: Amazon, BestBuy, and eBay.

## Functionality:
Currently, out of the 6 products for which the BigSemantics data is parsed, a user can select his/her top 3 choices.

## Credits
Since this was a simple static website, not using any web-framework like Rails or JSF, Heroku was not displaying it correctly when I first deployed the same. I followed the this post to get deployed application to work correctly on Heroku: https://gist.github.com/wh1tney/2ad13aa5fbdd83f6a489

Last but not the least, a big thanks to the developers of Bootstrap and JQuery, 2 of the best frameworks ever developed, which have helped make UI/UX development fast and easy.
