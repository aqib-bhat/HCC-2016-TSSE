The phone does have a nice strong build though, and the waterproof feature is cool. Overall the cons outweigh the pros so I gave it a friend and went back to my HTC 816. I would personally pass on this phone!",

                "description": "So Virgin Mobile has literally ruined my life for the last two weeks- I bought a new device and wanted it on my current phone number. Virgin Mobile instead gave me a Sprint Business phone number in random area code without my knowledge. After realizing thier mistake I called them and they told me they could do nothing because it was Sprint's problem. I called Sprint- they also can do nothing because my name is not on the account. They cannot cancel without the name, nor can they tell me who's name it is. Everyday at work, for two weeks, on my lunch, for an hour, I would call various departments, all who would redirect me because they can do nothing. 2 weeks later, I get someone who says they will move my new device onto my old phone plan. Instead, they move my old broken phone and number onto my new phone plan which I had stopped paying for... Because THAT makes more sense. Let's move a broken phone onto an unpaid plan, instead of a new phone onto a paid plan. I called back, they then say they moved the new device and the old number onto the unpaid plan. They then suggest that I pay them again, and the new phone will have my correct number. I do so. Now neither phones have service, and I am out $$. 10hrs+ over 2 weeks time and no solutions? Good job guys, no one should buy from you ever again.",
