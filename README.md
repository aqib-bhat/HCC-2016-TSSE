# HCC-2016-TSSE
This is the GitHub repository for the CSCE-655: Human-Centered Computing graduate course project

Our aim was to build a Technology Shopping Support Environment.

Functionality:


Issue not yet fixed:
1. Only 1 product showing out of 6 on the first page.

Features yet to be developed:
1. Showing facted metadata using nested metadata and meta-metadata in the BigSemntics data files.


Since this was a simple static website, not using any web-framework like Rails or JSF, Heroku was not displaying it correctly when I first deployed the same. I followed the this post to get deployed application to work correctly on Heroku: https://gist.github.com/wh1tney/2ad13aa5fbdd83f6a489

Sticky Notes feature included by using code from: http://tympanus.net/jstickynote/
